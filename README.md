# schedule-app

This application's primary function is to be a place to create, view, and edit schedules.

## The readme will currently be a place to write steps/objectives until a kanban board is set up.

1. build databse for employees and schedules
2. explore ways to parse data from excel sheets for schedules(currently schedules are sent through excel sheets, however eventually I would like an administrator to have the ability to create schedules within the app)
3. create a user friendly UI to view schedules
